# What is TimeScale Creator?

**TimeScale Creator** is an interactive **web-based tool** for visualizing and generating stratigraphic charts using a rich database of global and regional geologic events. Originally developed as a Java package, TimeScale Creator is now fully accessible online—no installation required.

### Overview

- Explore Earth's geologic history using interactive timelines and chart tools.
- Access over **20,000 biological, geochemical, geomagnetic, sea-level, and isotopic events** from our built-in datasets available to the public.
- All data is standardized to the **Geologic Time Scale 2020 (GTS2020)** models.
